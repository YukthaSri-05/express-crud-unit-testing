# 🗂️ Express CRUD Web Application using PUG and MongoDB

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a full-stack web application developed using **Express.js** with **PUG** as the server-side template engine. It performs complete **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations on a **MongoDB** database and emphasizes **code quality** by implementing **unit testing with 100% code coverage**.

The application showcases backend development, database interaction, server-side rendering, and testing best practices in a single project.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

* **Runtime:** Node.js
* **Framework:** Express.js
* **Template Engine:** PUG
* **Database:** MongoDB
* **ODM:** Mongoose
* **Testing:** Unit Testing Framework
* **Code Coverage:** Coverage Reporting Tool
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

* Build a structured Express.js web application
* Implement CRUD operations using MongoDB
* Render dynamic web pages using PUG templates
* Ensure application reliability through unit testing
* Achieve and maintain 100% code coverage
* Follow clean and maintainable coding standards

---

## 🏗️ Application Architecture

The application follows a **layered architecture** that separates responsibilities clearly:

* **Routing Layer:** Manages HTTP requests and navigation
* **Controller Layer:** Handles business logic and data flow
* **Model Layer:** Defines MongoDB schemas and data structure
* **View Layer:** Renders dynamic content using PUG
* **Testing Layer:** Validates functionality and edge cases

This structure enhances readability, scalability, and testability.

## 🗄️ Database Design

MongoDB is used as the primary database to store application records. Its flexible schema design allows easy handling of structured and semi-structured data. Database operations are managed efficiently using an Object Data Modeling approach.

---

## 🔄 CRUD Functionality

The application enables users to:

* Create new records through form-based input
* View existing records in a structured format
* Update previously stored data
* Delete records safely from the database

All operations are reflected dynamically through server-rendered views.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Code Coverage

Unit testing is implemented across core application components to:

* Validate route handling and controller logic
* Ensure correct database interactions
* Handle edge cases and error scenarios

A coverage reporting tool is used to confirm **100% code coverage**, reinforcing application reliability and reducing regression risks.

---

## 🔁 Application Workflow

1. User interacts with the web interface
2. Request is routed through Express
3. Controller processes the logic
4. Database performs the required operation
5. PUG renders updated views
6. Unit tests verify functionality and coverage

---

## ✅ Key Features

* Complete CRUD operations
* Server-side rendering using PUG
* MongoDB database integration
* Fully unit-tested codebase
* 100% code coverage
* Clean, modular architecture

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* Improve UI styling and responsiveness
* Add REST API endpoints
* Integrate CI/CD for automated testing

---

## 🧾 Conclusion

This project demonstrates a well-structured **Express.js CRUD web application** using **PUG and MongoDB**, with a strong focus on **testing and code quality**. By achieving **100% unit test coverage**, the application ensures reliability and maintainability. The project serves as a solid foundation for building scalable web applications and can be easily extended with additional features and security enhancements.
